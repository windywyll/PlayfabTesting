Playfab:
	
	Players:
		username : toto
		password : test123

		username : tattle
		password : test123

	Observations:
	The GameManager is the webpage of the game on PlayFab.

	The docs don't really help except to understand what variables to pass to functions and what you retrieve.
	The Webinars they've done have some quite good content even though some of it is obsolete.
	The forum can be a good start to search some help but the most helpful was the support by mail.
	Even though there can be some delay between the exchanges, due to the fact that playfab is in the United States,
	but they really try to see the problem to the end and not abandon midway.

	The title ID of Playfab must be filled on the GameObject that have the PlayFabAuthManager.

	The request to PlayFab can take some time and because they are asynchronous the script doesn't wait to have 
	the results to continue.

	The update of the ranking have been made by the client because the server wouldn't update my cloudscript.
	Of course it's best to just send the score to the cloudscript which will do the update.
	To disable the update by the client it should also be done in the GameManager -> Settings -> API Feature.

	Playfab allows the creation of leaderboards that automatically reset at certain frequency. (daily, monthly, etc..)

I use the FacebookSDK for unity v6.2.1
For Facebook must fill the object FacebookSettings, can be found in the tab Facebook.

If encountered the error:
	
	=>Unable to verify assembly data

		Check in FB Script in Facebook loader Class
		The region around the var assembly may not have the version of unity you work with.
		If you add it the problem should be solved.
